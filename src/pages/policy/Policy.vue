                <p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on our platform as enjoyable
                  and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use our platform’s vast array of information, tools, and
                  opportunities with complete confidence.
                </p>
                <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This
                  Privacy Policy describes how Propedia Pty Ltd (Propedia) collects information from all
                  end users of our Internet services (the “Services”) - those who access some of our Services but do not
                  have accounts (“Visitors”) as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee
                  to subscribe to the Service (“Members”) - what we do with the information we collect, and the choices
                  Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you
                  read this Privacy Policy carefully.
                </p>
                <p>Personal Information Propedia Collects and How It Is Used: Propedia collects
                  information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services
                  and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service.
                </p>
                <p>We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and
                  Services, and generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose
                  personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special
                  circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases
                  described below.
                </p>
                <p>Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our
                  Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, and the type of personal computer
                  being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the
                  registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes). This
                  information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special
                  circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>However, in instances where Propedia and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may
                  provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons
                  who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us
                  and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not
                  be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate
                  profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but
                  not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and
                  non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.
                </p>
                <p>Propedia Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and
                  Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To
                  provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and
                  maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is
                  collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an
                  affiliate, independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Propedia may share non-
                  identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, with
                  such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered.
                </p>
                <p>If you order services or products directly from Propedia we will use the personal information
                  you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except
                  to the extent necessary to complete that order.
                </p>
                <p>Online Advertisements: Propedia may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share
                  aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the
                  registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.
                  Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver
                  tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells
                  us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based
                  upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display or send the
                  advertisement to the intended audience. Propedia does not share personal information about its
                  Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.
                </p>
                <p>Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Propedia, the
                  return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Propedia does not use the
                  return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third
                  party.
                </p>
                <p>Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer
                  surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with
                  important information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we
                  provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even
                  if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. We
                  may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine
                  (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic
                  responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,
                  industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve
                  the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products.
                </p>
                <p>This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties. Special
                  Cases: It is Propedia’s policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors of
                  Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt
                  out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
                </p>
                <p>However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding
                  your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole
                  discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection
                  agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic
                  Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal
                  requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or
                  bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service,
                  or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect Propedia and our
                  Members. If you are a Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings and to provide
                  customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of
                  your customer information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites where you are
                  prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies.
                </p>
                <p>Propedia Commitment to Children’s Privacy: Protecting children’s privacy is especially
                  important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
                  and all other applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons eighteen years or older.
                </p>
                <p>Public Forums: Please remember that any information you may disclose in any Member Directory, or
                  other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise
                  caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas.
                </p>
                <p>Propedia’s Commitment to Data Security: Services and Web sites we sponsor have security
                  measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
                  While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot
                  guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining this
                  information.
                </p>
                <p>Where to Direct Questions About Our Privacy Policy: If you have any questions about this Privacy
                  Policy or the practices described herein, please contact us directly.
                </p>
                <p>Revisions to This Policy: Propedia reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy,
                  our Terms Of Service agreement, and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner,
